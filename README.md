This project implements an advanced neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a model with multiple dense layers, LeakyReLU activations, batch normalization, and dropout for improved performance and to prevent overfitting. The code includes custom data loading, data normalization, and a grid search for hyperparameter tuning across different layer configurations, node counts, dropout rates, and learning rates. Additionally, it visualizes training and validation accuracy and loss, providing clear insights into the modelâ€™s performance over epochs.
